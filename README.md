## Project Description
The aim of this project was to develop a software system as both a website and mobile application that can be used by the library of a small town. Users of the system are able to have online accounts that lets them browse, reserve and potentitally borrow various titles (books, movies, newspapers, etc.). Members of the town's community are also able to book the library for events online. The system will keep track of users' accounts, their balances, which can be viewed and managed by the library's employees (head librarian and regular librarians). The head librarian will also be able to manage general aspects of the library such as library information and the hours of workers there.

The project is split into 4 deliverables with each focusing on a part of the system:
1. Database
2. Backend
3. Web
4. Android
